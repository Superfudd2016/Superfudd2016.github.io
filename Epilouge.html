        <ul><span class="desc"> <span class="center">The shattered crown was scattered <span class="emphasis">across dimensions</span>, as were Magolor's <span class="emphasis">powers</span>. Now he seeks to <span class="emphasis">reclaim them</span>! Is this a journey of <span class="emphasis">penance</span> or <span class="emphasis">revenge</span>? And what surprises await at <span class="emphasis">the end</span>?!</span></span></ul>
        <p>After Kirby defeats Magolor and he is freed from the Master Crown's control, he gets set into a dimension and he has to go and defeat enemies to regain his powers back. In order to gain his abilities back, Magolor finds Fruit Fragments to create a Gem Apple Seed, because it contains immense magical power.</p>
        <h2 class= "subhead">Bosses</h2>
        <li>VS Electricky Dooter</li>
        <ul>"<span class="emphasis">Electricky Dooter</span> calls this dimension his home. Born from focused electircity, he loves to perform <span class="emphasis">shocking tricks</span>. As an <span class="emphasis">underling</span>, he was told to gather <span class="emphasis">Fruit Fragments</span> for their powerful life energy."</ul>
        <li>VS Fiery Puffer</li>
        <ul>"<span class="emphasis">Fiery Puffer</span> is a lava beast from this dimension. Born from elemental heat, he uses <span class="emphasis">scorching moves</span> that'll do more than melt. He still has to take the <span class="emphasis">Fruit Fragment</span> he found <span class="emphasis">back to his boss</span>..."</ul>
        <li>VS Hydriath</li>
        <ul>"<span class="emphasis">Hydriath</span> lives in the oceans of this dimension. Born from <span class="emphasis">water and ice</span>, his powerful <span class="emphasis">brawler moves</span> flows smoothly and effortlessly. His <span class="emphasis">Fruit Fragment will go to his boss</span>--unless you steal it first!"</ul>
        <li>VS Rampaging Doomers</li>
        <ul>"These <span class="emphasis">Rampaging Doomers</span> are from another dimension. Instead of hunting <span class="emphasis">spheres</span>, someone is making them seek <span class="emphasis">Fruit Fragments</span>. Wait...haven't we <span class="emphasis">met</span> the <span class="emphasis">big boss</span> of all Doomers already?!"</ul>
        <li>VS Crowned Doomer</li>
        <ul>"The boss of all Doomers has become a <span class="emphasis">black-winged subjugator powered by shards of the crown</span>...and he's after <span class="emphasis">Magolor's red fruit</span>! Is this <span class="emphasis">payback</span> for making Kirby gather those ship parts?!"</ul>
        <li>VS Master Crown</li>
        <ul>"Those who wear the <span class="emphasis">Master Crown</span> will <span class="emphasis">gain power</span>, but <span class="emphasis">so will the darkness in their hearts</span>. Thanks to the red fruit, it's become a wrathful wreath--a destroyer called the <span class="emphasis">tree crown without a ruler</span>!"</ul>
        <li>VS Master Crown (Ultra Sword)</li>
        <ul>"To free the tree and <span class="emphasis">bring an end</span> to the destruction... To take <span class="emphasis">responsibility</span> for <span class="emphasis">his wicked ways</span>... With <span class="emphasis">all of his magic</span> infused into the sword, he must strike! Magolor must <span class="emphasis">atone for his misdeeds</span>"</ul>
