        <h2 span class= "subhead">Characters</h2>
        <li>Kirby (1992)</li>
        <ul>"Inhale enemies to gain <span class="emphasis">Copy Abilities</span>! or hold the B button to <span class="emphasis">Super Inhale</span>."</ul>
        <li>King Dedede (1992)</li>
        <ul>"Make way for the <span class="emphasis">king</span> of Dreamland! I'm <span class="emphasis2">big</span> and <span class="emphasis">burly</span>, just like my hammer</span>. You won't get far without me...so I'm coming too!"</ul>
        <li>Meta Knight (1993)</li>
        <ul>"The <span class="emphasis">masked knight</span> enters, soaring through the <span class="emphasis">air</span> and deftly swinging his <span class="emphasis">sword</span>. His unrivaled speed</span> is the result of intense training!"</ul>
        <li>Bandana Waddle Dee (1996)</li>
        <ul>"Hey its <span class="emphasis">everyone's idol</span>! Don't let the cute fool you! He's a brave warrior who may be <span class="emphasis">small</span>, but his <span class="emphasis">spear</span> packs a huge <span class="emphasis">wallop</span>!</ul>
        <li>Magolor (2011)</li>
        <ul>"After betraying his <span class="emphasis">friends</span>, Magolor tumbled deep into a <span class="emphasis">dimensional abyss</span>. Now he must explore this place to <span class="emphasis">restore his lost powers</span>!"</ul>
        <br></br>
        <h2 class= "subhead">Bosses</h2>
        <br></br>
        <li>VS Sphere Doomer</li>
        <ul>"A <span class="emphasis">Super Ability</span> helped you enter this strange space, and a <span class="emphasis">Sphere Doomer</span> has flown in from a different dimension as well! It won't let you steal the <span class="emphasis">energy</span> of the spheres...so brace for an <span class="emphasis">attack</span>!"</ul>
        <li>VS Whispy Woods</li>
        <ul>"What does <span class="emphasis">Whispy Woods</span> want with the <span class="emphasis">ship part</span> it found? Maybe it's because it's so shiny? Whatever the reason, the guardian of the forest <span class="emphasis">does NOT want to share</span> it with Kirby!"</ul>
        <li>VS Mr. Dooter</li>
        <ul>"Ever the entertainer, <span class="emphasis">Mr. Dooter</span> is a <span class="emphasis">dangerous magician</span> able to summon snakes and skulls from his hat. But you're not here for the show. You're here for the <span class="emphasis">ship part</span> he found!"</ul>
        <li>VS Fatty Puffer</li>
        <ul>"Ahoy!<span class="emphasis"> Fatty Puffer</span>, a glutton of the sea, has surfaced! As he inhales, he'll <span class="emphasis">puff up to massive size</span>. Oh, and it looks like he's <span class="emphasis">swallowed</span> a ship part! Maybe that's how he got so <span class="emphasis">strong</span>..."</ul>
        <li>VS Goriath</li>
        <ul>"The snowy mountains are <span class="emphasis">Goriath</span>'s home. When this <span class="emphasis">powerful brawler</span> gets mad, he won't calm down...but you'll have to battle him anyway, because a ship part is hiding in his <span class="emphasis">lair</span>! Go <span class="emphasis">get it</span>!"</ul>
        <li>VS Grand Doomer</li>
        <ul>"It's the <span class="emphasis">boss of all Doomers</span>, the golden <span class="emphasis">Grand Doomer</span>! As the <span class="emphasis">skies</span> over Nutty Noon began to warp, this fearsome foe swooped in to claim the spheres--and their <span class="emphasis">dimension-traveling powers</span>!"</ul>
        <li>VS Metal General</li>
        <ul>"Long ago, the soulless battle robot <span class="emphasis">Metal General</span> would be <span class="emphasis">dispatched by its master</span> to visit other planets and <span class="emphasis">exterminate their foes</span>. Now it serves as <span class="emphasis">security</span>, guarding this spot for eternity."</ul>
        <li>VS Sphere Doomers</li>
        <ul>"Why does this dimension suddenly feel so <span class="emphasis">dark</span> and <span class="emphasis">murky</span>? Is it because you entered from Halcandra? There are a lot more Doomers here too...and some are even <span class="emphasis">pairing up</span> and <span class="emphasis">working as a team</span>!"</ul>
        <li>VS Landia</li>
        <ul>"<span class="emphasis">Landia</span>, the <span class="emphasis">4-headed guardian</span> who sleeps in <span class="emphasis">Haldera Volcano</span>, has been revered as this planet's <span class="emphasis">protector</span> since ancient times...so why is it <span class="emphasis">awake</span> now? And looking this way so <span class="emphasis">angrily</span>?! Eep!"</ul>
        <li>VS Lor & Magolor</li>
        <ul>"The <span class="emphasis">Lor Starcutter</span>, now controlled by the traitor <span class="emphasis">Magolor</span>, is being used <span class="emphasis">as a weapon</span> against Kirby and friends! If the shadowy ship <span class="emphasis">had a mind of its own</span>...how would it <span class="emphasis">feel</span> at this moment?"</ul>
        <li>VS Magolor</li>
        <ul>"<span class="emphasis">Magolor</span> is revealed as a manipulative mage who <span class="emphasis">tricked Kirby and friends</span> into fixing his ship, then stole Halcandra's legendary treasure, the <span class="emphasis">Master Crown</span>! It's up to <span class="emphasis">Kirby</span> to save the universe!"</ul>
